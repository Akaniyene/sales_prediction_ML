# About the task
Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions were provided. Each store contains many departments, and the task was to predict the sales for each department in each store. As a second layer of complexity, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. The markdowns are known to affect sales, part of the challenge was to predict which departments were affected and the extent of the impact.
